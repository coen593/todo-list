# todo-list

A Simple Todo list, where users can add projects and tasks. Data is stored in the local storage of the user's browser, and projects and tasks can be created, edited and deleted.

A live version of the app can be found [here](https://coen593.github.io/todo-list/).

The Todo List was written entirely using Vanilla Javascript and CSS for styling, and was created as an assignment of The Odin Project's Full Stack Javascript course. The assignment focused on OOP principles, and as such I have tried to keep all functionality in objects.
